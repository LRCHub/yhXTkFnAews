Well, empty out your pockets, 'cause here comes the Lord
You know you can't get into heaven carrying all that load
You know you can't to heaven, man, carrying all that load

Well, you're on that little black train from glory to the ground
When Jesus gets here, he's gonna burn that whole town down, yeah
When Jesus gets here, he's gonna burn that whole town down

Lay down your rifle now, here comes the Lord
Can't wade in the water, 'less you put the gun on the shore
You can't wade in the water 'less you leave your gun on the shore

Now you'll be riding that little black train from glory to the ground
When Jesus gets here, he's gonna burn that whole town down
When Jesus gets here, brother, he's gonna burn that whole town down

Are you lying to the people, friend?
You'd better cut that out
When the good Lord gets here, he's gonna stopper up your mouth
When the good Lord gets here, he'll stopper up your mouth

Well, you're riding that little black train from glory to the ground
Well, when Jesus gets here, he's gonna burn that whole town down
When Jesus gets here, he's gonna burn that whole town down

"Learn to live for your children," Reverend Davis said
The Devil's waiting to get 'em if you don't take their hand
Devil's waiting to get 'em if you don't take their hand

Well he's riding that little black train from glory to the ground
Yeah, when Jesus gets here he's gonna burn that whole town down
When Jesus gets here, he'll burn that whole town down

Empty out your pockets, 'cause here comes the Lord
Know you can't get to Heaven carrying all that load
Know you can't get to Heaven, brother, carrying all that load, no

Well he's riding on that little black train from glory to the ground
When Jesus gets here, he's gonna burn that whole town down
When Jesus gets here, he's gonna burn that whole town down
When Jesus gets here, he's gonna burn that whole town down
