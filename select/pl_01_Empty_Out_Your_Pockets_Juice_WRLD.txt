Empty out your pockets,
I need all that
Yeah, yeah
G-Money said,
"We need all the money, man"
Pennies and all that
With G-Money,
if I don't care if he got
a million in all pennies,
I'ma be
countin' Abe Lincolns all day
Yeah, yeah, uh
Empty out your pockets,
I need all that
I get the millions,
then I fall back
Niggas chameleons,
they'll change for some change
The days ain't the same,
niggas switch for the fame
Louis Vuitton, I'm in my bag
Get high, then my memory gone,
I've been hurtin'
I rock like electric guitars,
I be ragin'
Countin' big knots,
look like yellow pages
I run it like a race
Get in the way,
brodie got the aim
To blow you away, the next day,
you in the
newspaper on the front page
Prayin' for forgiveness '
cause it happened on a Sunday
Back to the cash,
rack after rack
So many racks that I sag
I just bought a bike,
catch me doin'
wheelies in the backstreet
Like I'm from where Meek Mill be
Put the "dead" in dead serious,
you try me, then you will be
On my wrist, it's a ICEE, no,
it ain't meltin'
Turn my closet to a freezer,
AP on the shelf (Gleam)
Everybody doubted me,
they ain't give me no help
(Please)
So all this money in my pocket,
I'ma spend it by myself (Self)
I bet you never felt
this pain I felt
When mom ain't had no money
and them bills brought hell
That's when G-Money hit my cell
Next day, would've fucked
up and ended up in a cell
Uh, oh, hell
(Fucked up
and ended up in a cell)
Ended up in a cell (In a cell)
Oh, hell
Yeah, yeah, uh
(Ended up in a cell)
Empty out your pockets,
I need all that
I get the millions,
then I fall back
Niggas chameleons,
they'll change for some change
The days ain't the same,
niggas switch for the fame
Louis Vuitton, I'm in my bag
Get high, then my memory gone,
I've been hurtin'
I rock like electric guitars,
I be ragin'
Countin' big knots,
look like yellow pages
