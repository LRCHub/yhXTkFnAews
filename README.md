[00:02.30] Empty out your pockets, I need all that, yeah, yeah
[00:06.21] G-Money said, "We need all the money, man, pennies and all that"
[00:15.02] With G-Money, if I don't care if he got a million in all pennies
[00:17.54] I'ma be countin' Abe Lincolns all day
[00:36.04] 
[00:19.39] Yeah, yeah, uh
[00:20.78] Empty out your pockets, I need all that
[00:22.97] I get the millions, then I fall back
[00:25.45] Niggas chameleons, they'll change for some change
[00:28.40] The days ain't the same, niggas switch for the fame
[00:53.90] 
[00:31.03] Louis Vuitton, I'm in my bag
[00:33.04] Get high, then my memory gone, I've been hurtin'
[00:35.76] I rock like electric guitars, I be ragin'
[00:38.79] Countin' big knots, look like yellow pages
[00:59.79] 
[00:41.48] I run it like a race
[00:43.20] Get in the way, brodie got the aim
[00:45.69] To blow you away, the next day, you in the newspaper, on the front page
[00:49.56] Prayin' for forgiveness, 'cause it happened on a Sunday
[00:52.14] Back to the cash, rack after rack, so many racks that I sag
[00:55.69] I just bought a bike, catch me doin' wheelies in the backstreet
[00:58.39] Like I'm from where Meek Mill be
[00:59.73] Put the "dead" in dead serious, you try me, then you will be
[01:29.73] 
[01:02.30] On my wrist, it's a ICEE, no, it ain't melting
[01:04.96] Turn my closet to a freezer, AP on the shelf (gleam)
[01:07.80] Everybody doubted me, they ain't give me no help (please)
[01:09.97] So all this money in my pocket, I'ma spend it by myself (self)
[01:13.69] I bet you never felt this pain I felt
[01:16.04] When mom ain't had no money and them bills brought hell
[01:18.81] That's when G-Money hit my cell
[01:20.51] Next day, would've fucked up and ended up in a cell
[01:46.01] 
[01:25.09] Uh, oh, hell (fucked up and ended up in a cell)
[01:27.42] Ended up in a cell (in a cell)
[01:30.92] Oh, hell
[01:32.61] Yeah, yeah, uh (ended up in a cell)
[01:50.11] 
[01:33.93] Empty out your pockets, I need all that
[01:35.95] I get the millions, then I fall back
[01:38.50] Niggas chameleons, they'll change for some change
[01:41.42] The days ain't the same, niggas switch for the fame
[01:44.12] Louis Vuitton, I'm in my bag
[01:46.05] Get high, then my memory gone, I've been hurtin'
[01:48.52] I rock like electric guitars, I be ragin'
[01:51.86] Countin' big knots, look like yellow pages
